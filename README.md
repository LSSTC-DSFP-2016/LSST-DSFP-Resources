# LSSTC-DSFP-Sessions

This repository houses the material and Jupyter notebooks associated with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope Corporation (LSSTC) Data Science Fellowship Program (DSFP).

The [LSSTC DSFP](http://ciera.northwestern.edu/Education/LSSTC_DSFPOverview.php) is a two year training program designed to teach skills required for LSST science that are not easily addressed by current astrophysics programs. The program consists of three, one-week schools per year over a two year period.


The LSSTC Data Science Fellowship Program is a supplement to graduate education in astronomy, intended to teach astronomy students essential skills for dealing with big data.
